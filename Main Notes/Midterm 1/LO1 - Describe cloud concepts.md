Describe Cloud Computing
--
- Cloud computing is delivery of computing services through the internet
- **Physical**
	- Physical power, security, maintenance and software is managed through the IT
- **Cloud**
	- Physical power, security, maintenance is managed through the service provider and software is managed through the IT
- There are three types of cloud computing
	- [[Infrastructure as a Service]] (IaaS) - Provider is only in charge of physical hardware, networking
	- [[Platform as a Service]] (PaaS) - Provider is becomes responsible for physical computing, operating systems, middleware, development tools and business intelligence services
	- [[Software as a Service]] (SaaS) - IT is in charge of software applications
- **Cloud models**
	- [[Public Cloud]]
	- [[Private cloud]]
	- [[Hybrid cloud]]
	- [[Multi-Cloud]]
- Public cloud providers
	- Microsoft Azure
	- Amazon Web Services
	- Google Cloud Platform
	- Oracle Cloud
	- Alibaba Cloud
- **Consumption based model**
	- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** - one time, up-front transaction to secure tangible resources
	- **Operating Expenses (OpEx)** - spending on services/products overtime
	- Cloud falls under OpEx as it operates on a consumption-based model where the user will pay based on the amount of resources that are being used in the infrastructure.
	- Allows to scale for what is needed for the business
	
Describe the Benefits of Using Cloud Services
--
- **High Availability**
	- Uptime and availability is maximized as per the service-level agreements (SLAs).
- **Scaling**
	- **Vertical** - This is scaling a single machines CPU, memory or storage
	- **Horizontal** - This is scaling the amount of machines in a system for distributing the load
- **Reliability**
	- Has multiple servers in different regions running in case a catastrophic event occurs
- **Predictability**
	- Performance can be predicted based on the resources needed
	- Cost can be predicted based on the cost of the cloud spend
- **Cloud features**
	- **Templates** - helps ensure that all resources meet corporate standards and government requirements
	- **Auditing** - helps flag resources that is out of compliance with corporate standards and provides migration strategies
	- Software patches and updates apply automatically
	- Typically well suited to handle attacks such as distributed denial of service(DDoS) as well

Describe Cloud Service Types
--
- [[Infrastructure as a Service]]
	- Equivalent of renting hardware from a datacenter
	- Can be good for shifting a on-premises datacenter to the cloud
	- You can create development and test environments for fast replication
- [[Platform as a Service]]
	- Best suited for completing a development environment
	- Provides a framework that developers can build upon to develop or customize cloud-based applications
- [[Software as a Service]]
	- Equivalent of renting or using a fully developed application
	- Requires the least amount of technical knowledge to employ
