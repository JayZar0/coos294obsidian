Configure Storage Accounts
---
- Azure Storage
	- Azure Storage is the cloud storage solution from Microsoft that can store files, messages, tables and other types of information
	- Developers can use for working data, including websites, mobile apps and desktop applications
	- Used by IaaS VMs, and PaaS cloud services
- Storage Categories
	- [[VM Data]]
	- [[Unstructured Data]]
	- [[Structured Data]]
- Storage Account Tiers
	- Standard
		- Uses HDD drives however the pricing of GB is low making it good for applications that require bulk storage where data is not accessed frequently
	- Premium
		- Uses SSDs drives which provides low latency making it good for I/O intensive applications like databases
- Azure Storage Services
	- [[Blob Storage]] - Massively scalable object store for text and binary data
	- [[Files]] - Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments
	- [[Queue Storage]] - Messaging store for reliable messaging between application components
	- [[Table Storage]] - NoSQL store for shemaless storage of structured or relational data
- Replication Strategies
	- Data in storage accounts are replicated for durability and high availability
	- Copies data so that it's protected from planned or unplanned events.
	- You can replicated data from the same datacenter, datacenters in the same region or across regions
	- [[Locally redundant storage (LRS)]]
	- [[Zone redundant storage (ZRS)]]
	- [[Geo-redundant storage (GRS)]]
	- Geo-Zone-redundant storage (GZRS)
- Storage Account Types
	- Standard General purpose v2
	- Premium block blobs
	- premium files shares
	- premium page blob
- Accessing storage
	- Every object stored in Azure storage has a unique URL address
	- The storage account name forms the subdomain portion of the URL
	- Combining the subdomain and the domain name forms the endpoint for a storage account

Create An Azure Storage Account
---
- Storage Account
	- A storage account is a container that groups a set of Azure storage services together
	- Combining data services allows managing them as a group
	- Each account represents a collection of settings like location, replication strategy, and subscription owner and it's best to create one for a new group of settings that will be applied to your data.

Configure Azure Blob Storage
---
- Implementation of Blob Storages
	- Blob storage uses three resources to store and manage your data
		- Storage Account
		- Containers in the Storage Account
		- Blobs in the Container
- Blob access tiers
	- Hot
		- Optimized for frequent rw of objects
		- Low access cost however higher storage costs than cool and archive
	- Cool
		- Optimized for storing large amounts of data that doesn't get accessed frequently
		- Useful for short-term backup and disaster recovery datasets and older media content
		- More cost-effective
	- Cold
		- Optimized for the same reason as the cool tier
		- Intended for data that can remain in the tier for at least 90 days
	- Archive
		- Offline tier that's optimized for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency
		- Includes secondary backups, original raw data and legally required compliance information
- Blob Types
	- Block Blobs
		- Ideal for storing text and binary data in the cloud, like files, images, and videos
	- Append Blobs
		- Useful for logging scenarios, where the amount of data can increase as the logging operation continues
	- Page Blobs
		- More efficient for frequent read/write operations
		- Azure VMs uses blobs for operating systems disks and data disks

Azure Files and Azure File Sync
---
- On-premises applications can also access file data in the shares
- Azure Files
	- Works as a true directory object in file shares
	- provides access to files across multiple vms
	- Can be mounted in linux distros by using the CIFS kernel client
	- Provides the capability to take snapshots of file shares
		- minimise the time requires o create share snapshots and saves on storage costs
- Azure File Shares
	- Azure File shares uses the SMB protocol and the NFS protocol
		- Doesn't support both protocols on the same file share
	- Can create file shares within the same storage account
	- There are two types of file shares
		- Standard and premium
		- The key differences are that premium uses SSDs and standard uses HDDs
- Azure Storage Explorer
	- Can access multiple accounts and subscriptions, and manage all your Storage content.
- Azure File Sync
	- Enables caching several Azure Files shares on an on-premises Windows Server or cloud virtual machine
	- Centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance and compatibility of an on-premises file server
	- Transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure File shares
	- Can use any protocol that's available on Windows server to access your data locally with Azure File Sync
	- There are four main components to provide caching for Azure Files shares on an on-premises Windows Server
		- [[Storage Sync Service]]
		- [[Sync Group]]
		- [[Azure File Sync agent]]
		- [[Registered server]]

Configure Azure Storage Security
---
- Security Strategies
	- Encryption - All data written to Azure Storage is automatically encrypted by using Azure Storage Encryption
	- Data in transit - Data can be secured between an application and Azure using Client-Side Encryption, HTTPS, or SMB 3.0
	- Disk Encryption - Operating System Disks and data disks used by Azure Virtual Machines can be encrypted by using Azure Disk Encryption
	- Authentication - Azure Active Directory and role-based access control are supported for Azure Storage for both resource management operations and data operations
	- Shared access signatures - Delagated access to the data objects in Azure Storage can be granted by using a shared access signature
	- Authorization - Every request made against a secured resource in Blob Storage, Azure Files, Queue Storage, or Azure Table Storage must be authorized.
- Authorization Options for Azure Storage
	- Entra ID
		- Option used to securely access Azure Storage without storing credentials in your code
	- Shared Key
		- Azure storage creates two 512 bit access keys for every storage account that's created
		- These keys grant clients access to the storage account
		- Microsoft recommends managing keys with Azure Key Vault since it's easy to rotate keys on a regular schedule to keep your storage account secure
	- Shared Access Signatures
		- Lets you grant granular access to files in Azure Storage, such as read-only or read-write access, expiration time, after which the SAS non longer enables the client to access the chosen resources
		- Grants permission to a storage resource and should be protected in the same manner as an account key
	- Anonymous access to containers and blobs
- Azure Storage Encryption
	- Data is encrypted automatically before it's persisted to their specified service
	- Data is automatically decrypted before retrieval
	- All data is encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption
	- Encryption is enabled for all new existing storage accounts and can't be disabled
