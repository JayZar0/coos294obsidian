Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run and manage applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. The service provider will handle the operating system, middleware, and runtime.

The user doesn't need to manage servers, patch software, or install runtimes. You just need to upload your code/application package, configure settings, and Azure will do the rest.
