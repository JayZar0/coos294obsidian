Every Azure region is paired with another azure region within the same geography. This helps support data residency, disaster recovery, and updates with minimal downtime

The benefits are
- Geo-redundancy 
- Automatic Replication
- Planned maintenance sequencing as Azure ensures that one region undergoes maintenance at a time
- Isolation from natural disasters since paired regions are typically isolated by hundreds of miles
