A logical unit of Azure Services that links to a billing account. Every resource created is always going to be associated to a subscription which is typically based on the resource group.

Defines a logical container for billing, resource groups, access control and policy enforcement. This can be a boundary to encapsulate resources, usage, and billing information. An account can have multiple subscriptions allowing for organization and encapsulation.

Multiple subscriptions are good to have because it helps with environment separation, department isolation, cost management, resource limiting, and security.
